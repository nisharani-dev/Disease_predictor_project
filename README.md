Disease Predictor using AI/ML

This project was developed as part of a bootcamp to build a Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning models. The system predicts possible diseases based on symptoms provided by the user.

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

---Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and prepared dataset with labeled diseases and corresponding symptoms.

Encoded categorical values into numerical form.

Split dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

---Model Design

Implemented machine learning models for disease classification.

Used algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes.

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and consistency.

---Evaluation

Models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Random Forest achieved ~97â€“99% accuracy (best performer).

Predictions were also tested on unseen test data provided during the bootcamp.

---Visualizations

Plotted confusion matrix for performance visualization.

Displayed feature importance (symptoms contributing most to predictions).

Accuracy comparison between models shown through bar charts.

---Test Cases / Predictions

Sample data from the bootcamp input symptoms were tested.

Example: For given test case, the model correctly predicted the target disease.

Confirms robustness of the system beyond training data.

âœ… Results & Insights

Random Forest outperformed other models with near-perfect accuracy.

Model was able to generalize well on unseen test data.

Symptom-based disease prediction is feasible with supervised ML methods.

ðŸ”® Future Scope

Integration with real medical datasets for higher reliability.

Deployment as a web or mobile app with user-friendly interface.

Combining with NLP for free-text symptom entry.

Expansion to include probability-based multi-disease predictions.
